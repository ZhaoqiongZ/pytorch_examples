# Examples of PyTorch for Intel GPU

## Examples

1. [Classification by ResNet18](./classification_detection/README.md)

- Run inference with pre-trained ResNet18 with FP16 data type on Intel GPU.

- Quantize the model as INT8 by PyTorch 2 Export Post Training Quantization (PT2E) and compare the performance and accuracy with FP16 model.


2. [Object Detection by FasterRCNN-ResNet50](./classification_detection/README.md)

- Run inference with pre-trained FasterRCNN-ResNet50 with FP16 data type on Intel GPU.


3. [Fine-tuning & Object Detection by YOLOv5](./yolo/README.md)

- Run fine-tuning based on pre-trained YOLOv5 model on Intel GPU.

- Run inference on Intel GPU.


4. [LoRA Fine-tuning on Intel GPU](./lora/README.md)

- Run LoRA fine-tuning based on pre-trained Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B model with custom small dataset on Intel GPU.
